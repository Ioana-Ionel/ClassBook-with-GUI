# repoDB
This is a student management application written in python.

The project was devided in view, controller and repository. The user interacts with the view class and the other classes are responsible of handeling the data and communicating with the database.

OOP concepts were introduced by making a class called students that has attributes and methods and also a class for the subjects.
It is connected to a MySql database so that the data is not lost when the aplication is closed.

In order to make it more user friendly I tried adding GUI using tkinter, but as far as design is concerned is not very pleasing.
